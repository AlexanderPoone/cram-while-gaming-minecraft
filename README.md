# unofficial-mc-mods-translations
This is a personal repo for cramming words in foreign languages while playing Minecraft, hence the term *crammese*. Even though I don't have much time since I'm occupied with work all the time, my life is dreadful and I just have to play Minecraft.

Requirements:
* Minecraft 1.19.4
