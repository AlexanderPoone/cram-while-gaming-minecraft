# minecraft-lang-cram
This repo generates a Minecraft resource pack, which provides side-by-side foreign language translations with memory aids (e.g., literal readings) for every English Minecraft in-game text. This enables cramming words and grammar rules (e.g., grammatical genders) of foreign languages (e.g., multiple variants of French and Spanish, as well as Romaji romanisation of Japanese) while playing Minecraft, hence the term *crammese*.

Even though I don't have much time since I'm occupied with work all the time, my life's dreadful and I just have to play Minecraft to lighten my mood. *\*sigh\**
