# `cram-while-gaming-minecraft`
Part of the *Cram While Gaming* series.

This repo generates a Minecraft resource pack, which provides side-by-side foreign language translations (e.g., multiple variants of French and Spanish, as well as Romaji romanisation of Japanese) with memory aids (e.g., literal readings) for every English Minecraft in-game text. This enables cramming words and grammar rules (e.g., grammatical genders) of foreign languages while playing Minecraft, hence the term *crammese*.

Even though I don't have much time since I'm occupied with work all the time, my life's dreadful and I just have to play Minecraft to lighten my mood. *\*sigh\**
